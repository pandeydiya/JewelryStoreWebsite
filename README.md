# JewelryStoreWebsite
A simple and elegant jewelry shop website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In this project, I have tried to develop a jewelry store website. This website has various interfaces like the landing page i.e. the home page and then it iterates to multiple pages present in the homepage. From the homepage, 07 other pages are i.e. the categories, gallery, contact, feedback, login, sign up, and an about us page respectively. The category has a further 04 pages attached to it i.e. the various articles that the store sells and it iterates through those pages respectively. The pages are as follows: necklace, bracelet, rings, and earrings. We also have form-based web pages like feedback, signup, login, and contact.

Now, if we look at how we created these pages, so we used various web programming attributes like HTML and JavaScript forms, navigation bar, tables, hero images, logos, and various other CSS attributes like padding, font families, list styles, margin, etc. We haven’t used a single API link from the web and used all the inbuilt features of HTML. 

FUTURE EXPANSION:
So, currently, this project is just a webpage where the user can contact the store to buy jewelry. But in the future, we can add a cart option along with some dynamic features so that the user can order jewelry from the website. We can also add some other categories in the future. Also, there is no database connectivity as of now so for the future log-in and for those payment details of the user a future updation would be required. Also, we could’ve made use of node.js or angular for  local host usage.
